# Bell Exchange

### Description

An app for the Walt Disney World Bell Service team to trade shifts, chat, and coordinate work/life balance

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Workplace solutions & Social Media
- **Story:** Coordinate with your coworkers fast! With over a dozen resorts and hundreds of cast members, this app offers a centralized place to trade shifts, get the latest Facebook group posts, or simply chat with the masses.
- **Market:** This app is for the sole use of the WDW Bell Service department. It has no affiliation with the WDW Company, nor targets any of it's IPs or customer base.
- **Habit:** A replacement for the Facebook exchange page. Anyone who wants to switch shifts can see posts and exchange shifts fast using Bell Exchange's precise scheduling filters to filter out the noise and only see what you want. No more doom scrolling the Facebook Group page!
- **Scope:** This is a workplace solution that can be expanded to other departments. I am an aspiring software engineer and (as of this writing) a current employee of the WDW Bell Service team. While it would warm me just to see my fellow cast use this app, a dream goal would be to have it received by the company as an open source project for all departments!
